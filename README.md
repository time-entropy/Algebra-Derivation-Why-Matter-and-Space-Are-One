The Unity of Matter and Spacetime: An Inseparable Connection

According to General Relativity, matter distorts the geometry of spacetime, while spacetime dictates the motion of matter through geodesics. This mutual influence suggests a deep interdependence—matter and spacetime are not separate entities but components of a unified structure.

From an algebraic perspective, module theory and category theory demonstrate that mutual interaction between two systems implies a shared underlying framework. In categorical terms, interactions are morphisms that preserve structure, meaning matter and spacetime must be fundamentally linked.

Thus, physically speaking, matter is not merely within spacetime—it is an intrinsic part of it. The two cannot be meaningfully separated; they form a single, coherent reality where matter shapes spacetime, and spacetime guides matter.

If matter were truly moving through space, it would necessitate alterations to the fundamental adjacency relations of spacetime—essentially "rewiring" its local structure. However, observations of black holes reveal that even under extreme gravitational conditions, spacetime's local topology remains smooth.

This suggests that what we perceive as particle motion is not traversal of a passive background, but rather the propagation of excitations within spacetime itself—a view fully consistent with General Relativity.

In this framework, the speed of light (c) emerges not as a limit imposed on objects moving through space, but as the maximum rate at which spacetime's excitations can propagate. Matter, then, is not separate from spacetime; it is a dynamic manifestation of spacetime's geometry.

The annihilation of elementary particles into electromagnetic radiation provides direct empirical support for this view. When particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, their mass-energy does not simply disappear into space—instead, it transforms into propagating excitations of the spacetime field itself. This process demonstrates that what we perceive as "matter" and "radiation" are simply different dynamic states of spacetime's underlying structure.
